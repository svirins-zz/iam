Now, with Emoji! 😉
Markdown parsing in Gatsby is done with [gatsby-transformer-remark][1], which
uses the excellent [remark][2] under the hood.\
Alongside remark we also use [gatsby-remark-smartypants][6], which provides smart
punctuation through [retext-smartypants][7].

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
